          <p>Over the years, so many people have played the Doctor that it's easy to lose count. In fact, it is now apparent, based upon recent plots, that the show could change actors indefinitely, or at least as long as the show is on the air. This page is a tribute to those actors that have played the Doctor over the past 53 years. Click on the photo to see each Doctor and read a little bit about him.</p>
